Welcome to the official repository of 'Out of the brew'

The game “Out of the brew” is made as a 3D VR project in the first block of us (RM Studios) , a group of students in the CMGT study program of the Hanze University of Applied Sciences. It's a 3D VR game for players of the age range 16-25, the main core of the game is to develop a concept that will be successful in 10 years’ time.

The game places the player in a magical lab, the player has to receive orders and create appropriate potions in order to progress. Learning to use different equipment and mix different ingredients to do so.

Design brief:

One of the main uses of games is as a tool to explore the possible uses of new technologies. In this course, students are challenged to make a game for 10 years in the future: what will that game look like, how will it play, who will play it? What is the next hit game for VR? What is the next technology to be mainstream in gaming? In attempting to address this design brief, students will address the question of ‘what is a game’ and will attempt to position themselves in this future.

Design Constraints

* Must be made in Unity.
* Must use one of the selected technologies.
* Must have a visual style appropriate to the technology.
* Must be playable at the demonstration.
* The game cannot have shooting.

In total this project has been developed in a period of 3 months time.
